<title>12月英语六级作文答案范文：有意义的生活_新浪教育_新浪网</title> 新浪教育[微博]讯 2013年12月14日全国大学英语六级考试已结束，本次考试为多题多卷，新浪外语第一时间收集整理不同版本试题，供考生参考，以下是2013年12月英语六级写作真题及范文(新东方版)：有意义的生活 Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay commenting on the remark “the greatest use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it。” You can give examples to illustrate your point and then explain what you will do to make your life more meaningful. You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words。 How to Live a Meaning Life Among all the highlighted topics, there is “how to live a meaning life?” Everyone has his or her own opinion. As the saying has it, “the greatest use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it。” I cannot agree any more。 If our life is just to pursue something for ourselves, we will surely feel fruitless and meaningless when we grow old. From Steve Jobs’s bibliography, we can get that the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. Steve Jobs has brought a great many changes to our world. His life, although short, definitely outlast. That’s a life worth living。 Therefore, if there is a way to make my life meaningful, it should be to find something I’m interested in and also helpful to others or the whole society. Only in this way can I keep my passion throughout my life until I finally fulfil my life。 【点评】 本次作文主题围绕“有意义的生活”，由于本次主题有些抽象，难度稍大。以下是一条可行思路：1.由谚语引出话题，表述自己对生活的看法。2.引出具体例子，作为自己观点的支撑。3.给出自己的行动方向，如何“过有意义的生活”。 更多四六级资讯，请关注@新浪每日英语推荐[微博] 直击2013年12月大学英语四六级改革后首考 2013年12月英语六级考后难度调查
