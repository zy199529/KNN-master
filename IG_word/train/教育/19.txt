<title>08年12月英语六级听力短文原文(沪江新东方)_新浪教育_新浪网</title> Passage One: To find out what the weather is going to be, most people go straight to the radio, television, or newspaper, to get an expert weather forecast. But if you know what to look for, you can use your own senses to make weather predictions. There're many science that can help you. For example, in fair weather, the air pressure is generally high, the air is still, and often full of dust. And far away objects may look vague. But when a storm is blowing, the pressure drops, and you are often able to see things more clearly. Sailors took note of this long ago, and came up with a saying:" The farther the sight, the nearer the rain." Your sense of smell can also help you detect weather changes. Just before it rains, odors become stronger. This is because odors are repressed in a fair high pressure center. When a bad weather low moves in, air pressure lessens, and odors are released. You can also hear an approaching storm. Sounds bounce off heavy storm clouds and return to earth with increased force. An old saying describes to this way:" Sound traveling far and wide, a stormy day will be tied." And don't laugh at your grandmother if she says she can feel a storm coming. It is commonly known that many people feel pains in their bones or joints when humidity rises. The pressure drops, and bad weather is on the way. 26. Why does the speaker say we can see far away objects more clearly as a storm is approaching? 27. What does the speaker want to show by quoting a couple of old sayings? 28. What does the passage mainly talk about?上一页 1 2 3 下一页    更多信息请访问：新浪四六级频道 四六级论坛 四六级博客圈 特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。
