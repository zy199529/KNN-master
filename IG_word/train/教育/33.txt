<title>08年6月英语四级考试作文范文(北京新东方版)_新浪教育_新浪网</title> 北京新东方学校四级作文教师 李艳华 Among various recipes one enjoys in his or her college life, recreational activities can by no means be ignored. It is numerous activities, such as spoken English competitions, sports events, and clubs and societies of different interests, that help to make campus life colorful and diversified. Facing so many interesting extracurricular activities, we college students have trouble to choose the proper ones. As freshmen, we are confused by all kinds of posters for students’ clubs to recruit new members. There are two opposite views about recreational activities. One says they exert positive influence on a student’s physical and mental development, for they can explore a student’s talent, develop a student's ability in communication, and teach them to be more independent. While, opposite voices can also be heard by asserting that recreational activities waste too much time, and therefore may hinder student from focusing on his or her study. As for me, I hold a belief that recreational activities do more good than harm, because I have always been of the impression that as a college student, he or she, besides the academic information, should pick up more practical skills to be better prepared for the career development. Recreational activities do give us a good chance. And, so long as one can arrange the time by reason, activities besides study will definitely provide more benefit for us.    更多信息请访问：新浪四六级频道 四六级论坛 四六级博客圈 特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。
