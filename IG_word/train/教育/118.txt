You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words。 作文范文： Happiness, as the saying has it, is not the absence of problems, but the ability to deal with them. In other words, people can never be happy if they focus on their difficulties and challenges. Simple as the remark may sound, it conveys a thought-provoking notion that happiness is a state of mind not an absence of problems。 First and foremost, it is well known that in order to be a strong individual, one needs obstacles to develop one’s strength, just like butterflies which struggle to be free of their cocoon in order for their wings to become strong enough to fly. Furthermore, just because people have a disadvantaged childhood, it does not mean they cannot be successful. Steve Jobs is a case in point. He was abandoned by his biological parents and dropped out of university but still managed to change the world。 To conclude, as the saying goes “You cannot run away from your problems. There is not a place far enough away。” Consequently, it is advisable for everyone to have a positive attitude toward their problems if they really want to be happy。 更多四六级资讯，请关注@新浪每日英语推荐[微博] 直击2013年12月大学英语四六级改革后首考 2013年12月英语六级考后难度调查
