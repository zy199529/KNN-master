How familiar these names are! Unfortunately, countlessstudents pay no attention to the study of Chinese. Nowadays, Internet, Englishand game occupy students’ time and attention. For the majority of students, thestudy of Chinese has become a remote memory。 Why such a phenomenon emerges? Educators attribute it to theignorance of university administration. Chinese is an essential course forcollege students in China.However, for a long time there has been a neglect in the study of Chinese. Takinga look around, every teacher encourages students to spend all time on learning English.On the contrary, none of them promotes students to learn Chinese. In the wakeof this situation, students will make growing Chinese mistakes in spelling,reading and speaking. Maybe someday, Chinese would fade from historical stage。 In my opinion, some drastic measures should be taken. First of all,we can raise students’ awareness that the study of Chinese is indispensable tous. In addition, teachers can offer more courses related to Chinese or Chineseculture. Finally, we can promote CCT(college Chinese testing) . In a word, due attentionshould be given to the study of Chinese。 文都徐可风点评： 命题者已经黔驴技穷，四级是Due Attention Should BeGiven to Spelling。只要把spelling 换成the study of Chinese就是六级作文了。 这次写作考试依然是中文提纲作文，要求同近年类似，即先描述、分析原因，再探讨可能导致的结果，接着提出自己的观点或建议。这只要是认真听了文都徐可风的相关课程，都会有所准备的。 来源：文都教育    更多信息请访问：新浪四六级频道 四六级论坛 特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。
