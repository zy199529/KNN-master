This issue has been brought into public focus and called for further concern。 A number of factors could account for the problem, but the following are the most critical ones. First, information is expanding at such an increasing rate that our society is called the one of information. The information is so immense that students haven' t ample energy and time to deal deeply with spelling, and some computer programs, such as word ,have done the spelling checking work for us . Second, the standardized-test oriented way of English learning, in which the high score can be achieved without spelling, put students to the position in which they have the quite reason to ignore spelling。 This issue may lead to a number of unfavorable consequences, with the following two the most serious. For one thing, the information would be incorrect when conveyed by hand- writing way and cause some bad effects. For another, we may indulge ourselves in this way of inaccuracy which may influence our attitude of learning or research. The awareness of the importance of this issue should be enhanced and some proper measures should be taken. It is reasonable for us to believe that the situation will be improved in the near future。 三段的第二种写法：In view of the importance of this issue , effective measures should be taken before things get worse. For one thing, it is essential that students should be encouraged to use less automatic spelling checking tools. For another, spelling should be highlighted in the English test ,such as CET-4 and CET 6.What’s more ,the public should enhance their awareness of the importance of spelling .With these measures taken, it is reasonable for us to believe that the situation of poor spelling will be improved in the near future。    更多信息请访问：新浪四六级频道 四六级论坛 特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。
